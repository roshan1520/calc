## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the calculator project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Git installed. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/).

### Cloning the Repository

1. **Clone the repository** by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/roshan1520/calc.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd calc


3. **Install dependencies (if applicable, e.g., for Bootstrap or other packages):**

   ```bash
   npm install
   
Running the Calculator
Since this is a front-end project, you can open the index.html file in your browser directly to view and use the calculator.


Alternatively, if you have a local server (like Live Server in VS Code), you can use it to serve the project:

   ```bash
   # Using Live Server
   npm start
