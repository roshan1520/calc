1. Clone the Repository
Cloning creates a local copy of a GitHub repository on your machine. Here’s how to do it:

Copy the Repository URL:

Go to the GitHub repository page (e.g., https://github.com/roshan1520/calc.git).
Click the green Code button and copy the HTTPS URL.
Run the Clone Command:

Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

Run the following command, replacing the URL with the one you copied:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/roshan1520/calc.git
This will create a local copy of the repository in a folder named calc (or the repository name) in your current directory.

Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd calc
2. Install Project Dependencies (e.g., for Node.js Projects)
If the project has dependencies (such as with Node.js projects), you’ll need to install them:

Install Dependencies:

In the project directory (e.g., calc), run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This command reads the package.json file and installs all the necessary dependencies into a node_modules folder.

3. Run or Build the Project
After installing dependencies, you can run or build the project as specified in the repository’s documentation:

Run the Project:

If there’s a start script defined in package.json, you can use:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Build the Project:

For projects with a build step, you may need to run:

bash

npm run build
Check the repository’s README file for any additional setup instructions or commands.
